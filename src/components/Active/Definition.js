              Tibetan Buddhists believe that saying the mantra (prayer), 
              Om Mani Padme Hum, out loud or silently to oneself, 
              invokes the powerful benevolent attention and blessings of Chenrezig, 
              the embodiment of compassion. Viewing the written form of the mantra is 
              said to have the same effect. It is often carved into stones and 
              placed where people can see them. 
              It is said that all the teachings of the Buddha are 
              contained in this mantra: Om Mani Padme Hum can not really be 
              translated into a simple phrase or sentence.
